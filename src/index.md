# about:
#     body: "As a teenager, my dream job was to be an international rock star üé∏ü§ü ! It obviously hasn't worked out ... Yet ! I decided then to complete a Marketing bachelor's degree, before moving on to a master's degree in IT Project Management, leading to my current Web/CMS Functional Analyst position. üéìüíº
#     <br><br>
#     I love helping businesses and people with their digital transformation. What I like especially is bridging the gap between the business and IT departments. The main challenge being to support a clear communication between completely different stakeholders. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
#     <br><br>
#     Besides work, I enjoy learning new web development skills üíª. I am also usually singing and practicing the piano üé§üéπ (I am clearly not giving up on my rock star career). Finally, I am the biggest fan of board game moments shared with friends, food and traveling as much as possible. üé≤üçî‚úàÔ∏è
